# A* Path Finding Algorithm

This is a visual tool, to show A* path finding algorithm in action. 
It finds the shortest possible path from the source to the destination.








## How to Use

The first tile marks the starting point and the second tile marks the end point.
You can select the first and second tiles wherever you want.
Then add the obstacles (marked with black tiles) wherever you want and click space bar to start the algorithm. Press 'c' key to clear the tiles and re-do a different maze for the algorithm to solve.
